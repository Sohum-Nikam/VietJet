# BrainQuest — Personalized AI-Powered Learning Platform
BrainQuest is an adaptive e-learning platform that revolutionizes the way children learn by tailoring educational content to their unique brain and learning styles. Moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all approach, BrainQuest leverages AI-driven brain assessments to understand each child’s cognitive abilities and places them on one of three customized learning journeys: Builder, Explorer, or Innovator.

Once categorized, students embark on a fully personalized and gamified learning experience that dynamically adapts to their pace and potential. Subjects such as Maths, Science, Geography, and EVS are brought to life through interactive animations, seamless transitions, engaging video lectures, and adaptive quizzes — all carefully designed to make learning both effective and enjoyable.

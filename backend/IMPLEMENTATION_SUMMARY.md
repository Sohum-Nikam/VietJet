## 🧠 Scoring Algorithm Details

### Score Components
1. **Raw Score**: Correct answers / Total questions
2. **Speed Score**: Response time vs. age-appropriate expectations
3. **Consistency Score**: Variance in response times
4. **Composite Score**: Weighted average (70% accuracy + 20% speed + 10% consistency)

### Category Thresholds
- **Innovator**: ≥80% accuracy (Advanced learners)
- **Explorer**: 50-79% accuracy (Curious learners) 
- **Builder**: <50% accuracy (Foundation learners)

### Cognitive Skills Tracked
- Pattern Recognition, Numerical Reasoning, Logical Thinking
- Spatial Awareness, Verbal Comprehension, Attention to Detail
- Problem Solving, Creative Thinking, Memory Recall
- Time Management, Empathy, Teamwork, Leadership, Adaptability
